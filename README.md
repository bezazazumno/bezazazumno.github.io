### Why would you want to add your event to devrel.events?
The simplest answer is that the more devrel.events we have on the website, the easier it is for everyone interested in developer relations to discover these events. And it feels like the majority of events are online-only for a while, so it makes a lot of sense to keep them all together.

### How do you move your real-life devrel meetup to an online format?
Probably the easiest way is to use Zoom or Google Meet and have it as a call in a format that makes most sense for your community. Presentations? Unconference? Panel? 

[Raise an issue](https://github.com/tooevangelist/tooevangelist.github.io/issues) or email to devrel.events@gmail.com if you need help starting your own online meetup around _developer relations, tech writing, developer community management and probably developer marketing_. Obviously I won't charge you =] This is a community initiative.
