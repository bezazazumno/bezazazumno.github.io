Games Tech + Stories is a series of community meetups to discuss game development tools and processes but also to celebrate the wins of the local gamedev industry.

It is a great opportunity to learn something new, see the cool things that local game developers make and meet new people.

To get a feeling what it is like - check out the pictures from our previous meetups.
