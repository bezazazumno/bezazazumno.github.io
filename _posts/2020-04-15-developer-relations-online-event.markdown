#### A bit more context for the curious:
There were many things that led me to kickstart this online meetup. Here's 3 from the top of my head:

Many devrel ppl became open to new opportunities
The real-life events probably are not to return until autumn
There's so much online events and meetings now, but few that are fun
I believe we can have fun while discussing various aspects of developer relations, a topic, many of us are so passionate about. And I believe these online meetups of ours can be cut into meaningful rewatchable pieces of valuable information, good for YouTube and useful for people.

So here we go. We can have fun, connect to peers and generate useful content. Also I'll make sure everyone on these videos looks and sounds good, has their social channels/LinkedIn featured.

Fun and useful is the best pitch of the event.
