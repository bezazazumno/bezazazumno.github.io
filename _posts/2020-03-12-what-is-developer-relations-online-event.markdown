I want to throw in a Google Meet video-call next week to share ideas and knowledge and to inspire each other. 
I want to take the best parts of our real-life DevRel Events and twist them to an online format in a meaningful way. 

Current format idea: we have 4 speakers (who change every time), each brings a devrel-related topic that we discuss together. Similarly to the unconference part of our events.

[This survey determines](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jiIOgeTsf6ZUDnr8dBc1mLSVRv0Omklw1BFbXZ-Nu3w/edit) when the meetup takes place and how it goes. Thanks for your opinion <3

The text below is same as above, just has more letters.

There were many things that led me to kickstart this online thing. Here's 3 from the top of my head:
- many devrel ppl became open to new opportunities
- the real-life events probably are not to return until autumn
- there's so much online events and meetings now, but few that are fun

I believe we can have fun while discussing various aspects of developer relations, a topic, many of us are so passionate about. And I believe these online meetups of ours can be cut into meaningful rewatchable pieces of information, good for YouTube and useful for people.

So here we go. We can have fun, connect to peers and generate useful content. I'll make sure everyone on these videos looks and sounds good, is easy to find for the viewers. 

Fun and useful is the best pitch of the event.
