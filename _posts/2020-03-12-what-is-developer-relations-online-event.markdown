Folks, this self isolation is creepy... There's a good chance the real-life DevRel Event has to be postponed to Autumn. Shall we do something fun online instead?

#### Devrel Online Meetup pitch:
I want to take the best parts of our real-life DevRel Events and twist them to an online format in a meaningful way. Think a panel discussion or an unconference:

* 4 cool speakers (who change every time), 4 devrel-related topics to discuss.
* 15-20 minutes per topic + Q&A with the chat.
* The recordings end up on YouTube in a few weeks.

#### Possible topics:
* Presenting to a screen vs Presenting to a live audience
* Do you hate webinars as much as I do?
* Making your documentation open source
* How to make sure you have current and enough documentation

#### Speakers:
Confirming as you read this =]

Also please poke back to devrel.events@gmail.com if you'd like to speak at the next devrel meetup online.

#### A bit more context for the curious:
There were many things that led me to kickstart this online meetup. Here's 3 from the top of my head:

* Many devrel ppl became open to new opportunities
* The real-life events probably are not to return until autumn
* There's so much online events and meetings now, but few that are fun
* I believe we can have fun while discussing various aspects of developer relations, a topic, many of us are so passionate about. And I believe these online meetups of ours can be cut into meaningful rewatchable pieces of valuable information, good for YouTube and useful for people.

So here we go. We can have fun, connect to peers and generate useful content. Also I'll make sure everyone on these videos looks and sounds good, has their social channels/LinkedIn featured.

#### Fun and useful is the best pitch of the event.
