## <a name="season1"></a> Would you like to support these meetups?
We're a new initiative trying to build an inclusive community for tech leads and developer relations professionals by creating quality content with global appeal and unique touch.
We don't talk D&I, we operate with D&I in mind to create the content of better quality. 

You can support us by letting more people know about these events. 
Inviting your community or colleagues to our meetups is of great help.
But if you have something else in mind, please talk to us!

* We can add you as a co-host on [Facebook.com/devrel.events](https://www.facebook.com/devrel.events) 
* We can let you know in advance when we publish new events on [devrelevents.eventbrite.com/](https://devrelevents.eventbrite.com/)
* We craft a message of why we like you
* * On every event ad of ours over FB, EB, Meetup, [devrel.events/live](https://devrel.events/live/)
* * Under YouTube videos from the events that you will have supported
* * Under each podcast episode when we ship our YouTube videos as podcasts
