## We run bi-weekly meetups with one of the following themes:
* [How to measure KPIs in Developer Relations](https://devrel.events/kpi-devrel-leads/)
* [Community leadership and developer events](https://devrel.events/online-conferences-virtual-events/)
* [Youtube and blogging for programmers](https://devrel.events/youtube-dev-blogs-tech-influencers-meetup/)
* [Public speaking for programmers](https://devrel.events/technical-speaking-training-workshop/)
* [ Your API reference is your evangelist](https://devrel.events/openapi-developer-manuals-api-reference/)

Each meetup has a slightly different audience and mood but bases on a consistent format and values that define the experience.

Our meetups tend to attract senior technical professionals such as lead developers, tech leads, developer relations professionals and alike.

We stream our meetups live at [devrel.events/live](https://devrel.events/live), then upload to [youtube.com/devrelevents](https://www.youtube.com/devrelevents) as short watchable pieces of great content.

## Would you like to support these meetups?
We're a new initiative trying to build an inclusive community for tech leads and developer relations professionals by creating quality content with global appeal and unique touch.
We don't talk D&I, we operate with D&I in mind to create the content of better quality.
