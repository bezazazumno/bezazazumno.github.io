## Code Of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is a vital part of making our community inclusive and friendly. That’s why we expect everyone participating in our organised or affiliated meetups or events to read and adhere to this Code of Conduct. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us via email: team@devrel.events, or speak to anyone in Devrel Events team in person.

### PURPOSE
We believe our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, preferred operating system, tabs or spaces, programming language, or text editor.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behaviour as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

We ask all attendees, sponsors, volunteers, speakers, suppliers and other participants to help us realise a safe and positive conference experience for everyone.

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR

Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.

Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behaviour and speech.

Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert conference organisers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.

Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to create Build Stuff Conference and make it your own.

### UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR

Unacceptable behaviours include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any attendees of Build Stuff Conference and related events.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

While we encourage discussion, we will not tolerate people interrupting speakers during their talks (unless the speaker has specifically said it is OK to interrupt with questions).

### WHAT TO DO IF YOU WITNESS OR ARE SUBJECT TO UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR?

If you are subject to unacceptable behaviour, notice that someone else is being subjected to unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify anyone of Devrel Events team or our affiliates as soon as possible.

### CONSEQUENCES OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR

​Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated whether by other attendees, organisers, sponsors, volunteers, or other patrons of Devrel Events.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behaviour, Devrel Events team or associates may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the event or community without warning.

### OPEN SOURCE CITIZENSHIP

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognise and strengthen the relationships between what we do and the community at large.

In service of this goal, Devrel Events team will recognise select community members on the devrel.events website, at our organized meetups and in the Discord community.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. You can nominate someone by speaking to anyone in Devrel Events team or by emailing to team@devrel.events

### SCOPE

We expect all community and our meetups participants (sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct.

### REPORT A CODE OF CONDUCT INCIDENT ONLINE

You can contact the Code of Conduct team by emailing to team@devrel.events.

This mailbox is accessible only to the core team of Devrel Events. We won’t discuss your message with anyone outside our core team without first discussing this with you.
