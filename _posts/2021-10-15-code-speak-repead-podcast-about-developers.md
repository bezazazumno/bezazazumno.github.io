### Code, Speak, Repeat podcast is like a hallway track at your favourite developer conference. 

Imagine...We again can meet people, hug friends and go to crowded places like meetups and developer conferences.

Imagine, you overhear a conversation you like: people who you don't know discuss live coding, new company practices for personal growth or new cool tools for remote work.

You decide to join the discussion, share your opinion, then notice more people have joined. It is fun and inclusive.

You can actively participate in the dialogue, then easily connect to the people you liked. Or just feel you had a good time, perhaps learned something and it is now time for you to go mind your business. You smile and turn off the Code, Speak, Repeat live podcast.

This short tale describes emotions we hope to bring you with Code, Speak, Repeat.
