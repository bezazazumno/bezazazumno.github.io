## Our meetups feature talks like these:
It is a playlist with some of the talks from our meetups. It has also some of the panel discussions.

Honestly, we're experimenting with content strategy at the moment, and we try out different things. But perhaps check out some of the videos in the playlist to understand better of what happens at our meetups.

And perhaps consider subscribing to [youtube.com/devrelevents](https://www.youtube.com/devrelevents) =]

## Our speakers are 
developers, tech writers, developer advocates, community managers, conference organisers, devops people, developer managers and anyone who can contribute to the topics in discussion. 

We try to balance each meetup to feature speakers with different experience and background, so we all are able to learn something new and have fun. or vice versa =] 

Think of a hallway track at your favourite industry event. This is what we're aiming at here.

## TL;DR:
* Your talk is 10 minutes
* If you go over time, we'll have less (or no) time for Q&A
* You can show slides or share the screen

## More context:
* You're one of the 3 speakers
* We'll have a panel discussion after all the talks - see the schedule at [devrel.events/live](https://devrel.events/live/)
* If you want to, you're welcome to have a slide about what you do and where to find you
* Your talk will be streamed live and then posted on [youtube.com/devrelevents](https://www.youtube.com/devrelevents)
