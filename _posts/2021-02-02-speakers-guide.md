Our and my humble ambition is to have speakers as diverse as possible with each meetup having a clear theme. Speakers are developers, tech writers, developer advocates, community managers, conference organisers, devops people, developer managers. We try to balance each meetup to feature diverce voices with different experience. 

## TL;DR:
* Your talk is 10 minutes
* Your talk has a single take-away message
* You can show slides or share a screen
* Think of a hallway track at your favourite industry event. This is what we're aiming at here.

## More context:
* You're one of the 3 speakers
* We'll have a panel discussion around your talk's message after your talk
* The panel discussion after your talk is usually 10-15 minutes long
* If you want to, you're welcome to have a slide about what you do and where to find you
* Your talk will be streamed live and then posted on [youtube.com/devrelevents](https://www.youtube.com/devrelevents)

To make these meetups event more fun we inspire you to invite a friend, perhaps share the event to your professional network. Maybe also suggest your marketing department to tweet about the meetup? After all, you'll be one of the stars of the show!  

*BONUS:* [Here's an event demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHj5HiV2fPA) for you to get inspiration from
