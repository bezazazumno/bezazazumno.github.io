We solve the developer marketing challenge and help companies talk to their geeky users. 
We help developers-focused companies with customer development and brand, product awareness in developer community.

There's more to it, but a simple take sounds like this:

#### We make live meetups for programmers and produce videos, podcasts, blogposts, vertical shorts out of it.
It is like having a developers-focused marketing department with experienced developer advocates and a dedicated content production team with artists, deisgners, audio/video producers, copywriters, the events team, the meetups team and the social media team.

Yess, we're that great! You can see [the case-study]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/).

#### Core team
We are 3 lovely human beings (the cover drawing is a proofpic) who are full-time.
We have a network of trusted partners so we can scale up and down as needed.

#### Our strength
Our strength is in diversity of mindsets and skillsets what lets us see the bigger picture:

* We're proud of having 66.6% women talent on board
* Each of us has relocated to at least 1 new country and at least 3 new cities 
* Each team member despite having a focus (business, content/community, product) is also hands-on in production

#### Still not convinced that we're awesome?
We wanted to save you a click, but hey, it is imoprtant what you want =)
