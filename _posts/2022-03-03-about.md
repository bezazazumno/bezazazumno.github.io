We solve developer marketing challenge and help companies talk to their geeky users, such as programmers. 
We help developers-focused companies with customer development and brand, product awareness.

There's more to it, but a simple take sounds like this:

#### We make live meetups for programmers and produce videos, podcasts and blogposts out of it.
It is like having a developer focused marketing department with experienced developer advocates and content production team.

* A story of why we exist overall
* 3 core team members
* A set of trusted partners so we can scale up and down as needed
