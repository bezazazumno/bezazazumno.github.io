## We're working hard on this page
Currently it has mostly palceholders. But hey, we're a young org. We'll make it! 

In the meantime watch our meext meetup at [devrel.events/live](https://devrel.events/live)

## How this page gonna work soon:

We run bi-weekly meetups that have various themes, such as "public speaking for devs", "KPIs in devrel" and more. Each themed meetup has a slightly different audience and mood but a consistent format that defines the user experience.

We stream our meetups live at [devrel.events/live](https://devrel.events/live) and then upload to [youtube.com/devrelevents](https://www.youtube.com/devrelevents) as short watchable pieces of great content.

We reach out to audience via:
* Eventbrite
* Facebook Group
* Newsletter
* Social Reach or our team

Currently we define 3 levels of collaboration:
#### general partner 
#### event partner
#### communications partner

## These are companies and organisations that we're currently working with: 
* Civo Cloud
* SlashData
* Grafana
* WGT
* VTP
