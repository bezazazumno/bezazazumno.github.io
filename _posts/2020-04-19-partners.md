## We run bi-weekly meetups with one of the following themes:
* [How to measure KPIs in Developer Relations](https://devrel.events/kpi-devrel-leads/)
* [Community leadership and developer events](https://devrel.events/online-conferences-virtual-events/)
* [Youtube and blogging for programmers](https://devrel.events/youtube-dev-blogs-tech-influencers-meetup/)
* [Public speaking for programmers](https://devrel.events/technical-speaking-training-workshop/)
* [ Your API reference is your evangelist](https://devrel.events/openapi-developer-manuals-api-reference/)

Each themed meetup has a slightly different audience and mood but bases on a consistent format and values that define the experience.
Our meetups tend to attract senior technical professionals such as lead developers, tech leads, developer relations professionals and alike.
The speakers are more diverse to explore the topics from various sides and offer more context and interesting thoughts overall. 

We stream our meetups live at [devrel.events/live](https://devrel.events/live), then upload to [youtube.com/devrelevents](https://www.youtube.com/devrelevents) as short watchable pieces of great content.
