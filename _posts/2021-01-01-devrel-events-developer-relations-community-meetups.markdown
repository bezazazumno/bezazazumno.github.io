This is a regular markdown file found [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/tooevangelist/tooevangelist.github.io/tree/master/_posts). Make a copy of it on your fork. Name it as: _your-event-date-your-event-name.md_ and edit the text below and above. Send a pull request to Master for your changes to appear on https://devrel.events

Need a better step-by-step guide or have a question? [Raise an issue](https://github.com/tooevangelist/tooevangelist.github.io/issues) and I'll be around to help.

### Why would you want to add your event to devrel.events?
The simplest answer is that the more devrel.events we have on the website, the easier it is for everyone interested in developer relations to discover these events. And it feels like the majority of events are online-only for a while, so it makes a lot of sense to keep them all together.

### How do you move your real-life devrel meetup to an online format?
Probably the easiest way is to use Zoom or Google Meet and have it as a call in a format that makes most sense for your community. Presentations? Unconference? Panel? 

[Raise an issue](https://github.com/tooevangelist/tooevangelist.github.io/issues) or email to devrel.events@gmail.com if you need help starting your own online meetup around _developer relations, tech writing, developer community management and probably developer marketing_. Obviously I won't charge you =] This is a community initiative.

### What to think about when adding an event?
* Link to how to register for the event, probably on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/developer-relations-events-26740448969) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pg/devrelevents/events/)
* HTML mostly works well, so you can include online images like this:
<img align="right" width="300" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/3ofus_400_white.png">
* Please upload your images to _/assets/img/your-event-name_
* This website is built with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so is basically a set of Jekyll generated static pages
* If you're doing something beyond basic edits, please check on your local Jekyll setup first.


### You can add HTML snippets like a Mailchimp signup form or Eventbrite register form 



<!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->
<link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style type="text/css">

	/* Add your own Mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.
	   We recommend moving this block and the preceding CSS link to the HEAD of your HTML file. */
