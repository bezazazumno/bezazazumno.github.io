## Strong opinions about online communities and tools

Imagine...We again can meet people, hug friends and go to crowded places like meetups and conferences.

Imagine, you overhear a conversation you like: 4 people who you don't know discuss community-building, tools and best practices, then touch on industry news and argue about eternal matters. What makes the community a safe place or how do you keep it active?

You decide to join the discussion, share your opinion, then notice more people have joined. You understand, people in this group have loads of community-building experience and run related businesses.

It is fun and inclusive. You can actively participate in the dialogue, then easily connect to the people you liked. Or just feel you had a good time, perhaps learned something and it is now time for you to go mind your business. You smile and turn off the F.K Webinars podcast.

This short tale describes emotions we hope to bring you with F.K Webinars podcast.
