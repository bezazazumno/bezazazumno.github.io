## How do you bring your new ads SDK, a game engine plugin, a networking backend or any other API, software or service to game developers since outbound sales and conferences became inefficient?

Let us do it for you. We’re leveraging the new reality, new content consumption habits and new content formats while building an inclusive and global developer community on Discord.

## we’re solving the challenge of software and services marketing to game developers by hosting live meetups, and producing likable content on YouTube, as podcasts, as 1-minute vertical shorts for social media.

You get a healthy mix of developer marketing, developer content production and developer relations, depending on where you are and what are your needs.

## There's a waiting list to start working with us

We're onboarding new partners when we feel that we're able to offer the focus, the attention and the service on the top level.
Normally we're starting new initiatives when we have several partners with similar needs, targeting similar audience.

In other words, please fill in the form, we'll get back to you at some point.
