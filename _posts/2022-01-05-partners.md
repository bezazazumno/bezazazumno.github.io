## We solve the developer marketing challenge and help companies talk to their geeky users. 

We help developers-focused companies with customer development and brand, product awareness in developer community.

There's more to it, but a simple take sounds like this:

#### We make live meetups for programmers and produce videos, podcasts, blogposts, vertical shorts out of it.
It is like having a developers-focused marketing department with experienced developer advocates and a dedicated content production team with artists, deisgners, audio/video producers, copywriters, the events team, the meetups team and the social media team.

## There's a waiting list to start working with us

We're onboarding new partners when we feel that we're able to offer the focus, the attention and the service on the top level.
Normally we're starting new initiatives when we have several partners with similar needs, targeting similar audience.

In other words, please fill in the form, we'll get back to you.

## Content<a name="content"></a>

We’re leveraging the new reality, new content consumption habits and new content formats while building an inclusive and global developer community on Discord.

    </tr>

This is an example of our content pipeline. We hosted a live meetup on a particular topic where Ciro, a Unity's Creator Advocate, did a talk along 3 other speakers. We published his talk as a separate YouTube video and produced a podcast that features his talk and the panel discussion around his talk.

Interviews like these two serve multiple purposes - they inspire your community, showcase your tools and make great content for social networks and newsletters.
In King's case some of the developer videos were shipped along the documentation to better explain how the tools work.

We understand game developers. We are technical ourselves. We can produce videos like these without guidance or technical supervision.
Naturally, we come with ideas for the videos, make production plans and execute.

These two examples come from pre-COVID era. We're well-suited to shot developer videos on-site as well as in our new remote-first reality.


## Developer Marketing<a name="marketing"></a>

How do you bring your new ads SDK, a game engine plugin, a networking backend or any other API, software or service to game developers since outbound sales and conferences became inefficient?
With us you get a healthy mix of developer marketing, developer content production and developer relations, depending on where you are and what are your needs.

Coherence didn't have a showable prototype, yet they wanted to start talking to developer community to get feedback and bounce back ideas about their product. So we conducted a set of short interviews optimised for social networks and quick consumtion to build emotional connection and trust in developer community. 

<table class="table" width="100%" height="auto">

      <td class="td" width="50%" height="auto"><div class="embed-youtube">

</div></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Super.com needed a product tour and a marketing copy when publishing one of their new tools to Product Hunt.
We came up with a video script, researched the platform requirements and took all the production work.


## Virtual Events<a name="virtual"></a>

We’re solving the challenge of software and services marketing to game developers by hosting live meetups, and producing likable content on YouTube, as podcasts, as 1-minute vertical shorts for social media.

<div class="embed-youtube">
<iframe width="50%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1rmfb45q5b0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

We hosted a public SlashData-themed event with mandatory registration and a custom form to research the attendees. The focus was on amplifying SlashData community during the silent summer time. 
The SlashData's talk was published as a YouTube video and will be shipped as a podcast soon along with a discussion panel around it.

</div><p>DevGAMM founder talking at our live meetup</p></td>
    </tr>
</table>

We produced, organized and hosted a closed virtual after-party for DevGAMM conference. As always everything from idea to executon was on our side.

As a bonus, the DevGAMM founder delivered a talk on our live meetup, this talk was published on YouTube.


## IRL Events<a name="irl"></a>

<img align="center" width="50%" height="auto" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gamestech-500p.png">

We were responsible for delivery of 3 developer events to celebrate a new regional Unity office.
The event were planned as hybrid with remote speakers and livestreaming plus activities for a local audience in the office.
The technical part, the org part and the delivery were on us.
[Here's the event brief]({{site.baseurl}}/gamestech-stories-unity3d-meetup/)


<img align="center" width="50%" height="auto" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/peltarion-500p.jpg">

Peltarion wanted to learn more about developer relations, so we hosted a developer relations meetup in their office. It was an IRL meetup, focused on loca vibe and professional networking. Peltarion people delivered a keynote, then we facilitated an unconference to inspire the networking and good vibes.
[Here's how the event looked like](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=devrel.events&set=a.120894999474395)
