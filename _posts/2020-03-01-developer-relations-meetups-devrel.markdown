The next Developer Relations meetup is at Grafana Labs office.

The mood of the event is developer relations and open source.

The event is free and open to anyone working or interested in developer relations, developer evangelism, developer communities and alike. It is a great opportunity to meet likeminded people and learn something new.

To get a feeling what it is like - check out the pictures from previous DevRel meetups.
