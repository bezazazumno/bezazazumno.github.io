## Wanna speak at Devrel Online Meetup?
#### TL;DR:
* Your talk is 8-10 minutes
* Your talk has a single take-away message
* You can show slides or share a screen

#### More context:
* You're one of the 3 speakers
* We'll have a panel discussion around your talk's message after your talk
* The panel discussion after your talk is usually 10-15 minutes long
* It is fine if your talk provokes a good discussion, but it also has to provide a good statement
* If you want to, you're welcome to have a slide about what you do and where to find you
* If you like this all, feel free to invite a friend to speak or to join the live-stream
* Your talk will be streamed live and then posted on [youtube.com/devrelevents](https://www.youtube.com/devrelevents)
* Obviously you're very welcome to bring in your community, share the recording, etc. Thank you!

*BONUS:* [Here's an event demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHj5HiV2fPA) for you to get inspiration from

## Who are the speakers?
Our and my humble ambition is to have the speakers as diverse as possible with each devrel meetup focusing on a 1 certain aspect of what we care about in devrel. In other words, devrel meetups exist to facilitate comprehensive dialogue across the industry with a focus around developer relations. Think of a hallway track at your favourite industry event. This is what we're aiming at here.

The format evolves and improves with your feedback. So please take your time to share your thoughts with us.

## Do you have a schedule for future events?
The high ambition is to have biweekly devrel events, but sometimes we do custom events if somebody asks us to. Check out [devrelevents.eventbrite.com](https://devrelevents.eventbrite.com/) to see what's on currently.

Themes for events are often defined by people like you, who are willing to come and do a presentation around a topic they're passionate about.

So let us know of a topic you'd like to deliver a talk about. We'll pair you up with peers and will arrange a devrel event around your topic.

*NOTE:* If you need help with starting a community meetup of your own, perhaps we can help. See [readme.md](/README.md)

#### Current events plan:
* May 13 - public speaking for programmers, part 1
* May 27 - online conferences that make sense
* June 10 - public speaking for programmers, part 2
* June 24 - KPIs for devrel
* July 8 - public speaking for programmers, part 3 <-- we have 2 speaking slots here
* July 22 or 29 - we can have an event around the topic you're passionate to drive forward

#### Themes that we'd like to bring up, but don't have anything scheduled yet:
* Design, UX and devexp in devrel

## Are the talks recorded?
Yes. We all join in the live-stream about 15 minutes before the start, hang out with people in the chat, tune in the equipment, test slides, say hi. It is only the talks and post-talk discussions that end up on [youtube.com/devrelevents](https://www.youtube.com/devrelevents)
