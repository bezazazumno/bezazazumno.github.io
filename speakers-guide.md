## Who are the speakers normally?
Our and my humble ambition is to have the speakers as diverse as possible with each devrel meetup focusing on a 1 certain aspect of what we care about in devrel. In other words, devrel meetups exist to facilitate comprehensive dialogue across the industry with a focus around developer relations. Think of a hallway track at your favourite industry event. This is what we're aiming at here.

The format evolves and improves with your feedback. So please take your time to share your thoughts with us.

## Do you have a schedule for future events?
The high ambition is to have biweekly events. The first place we announce our events is [devrelevents.eventbrite.com](https://devrelevents.eventbrite.com/). 
Themes for events are often defined by the speakers. So let us know of a topic you'd like to deliver a talk about. We'll pair you up with peers and will arrange a devrel event around your topic.

*NOTE:* If you need help with starting a community meetup of your own, perhaps we can help. See [readme.md](/README.md)

#### Current event plan:
* One more public speaking for programmers meetup
* Meetup about online events for programmers
* Design, UX and devexp in devrel
* How to become a good developer advocate
* Designing educational content for developers

Have a great idea for a devrel event topic? Let us know!

## Are the talks recorded?
Yes. We all join in the live-stream about 15 minutes before the start, hang out with people in the chat, tune in the equipment, test slides, say hi. It is only the talks and post-talk discussions that end up on [youtube.com/devrelevents](https://www.youtube.com/devrelevents)
